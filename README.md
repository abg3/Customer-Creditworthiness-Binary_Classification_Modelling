# Customer Loan Creditworthiness

A small bank which typically gets 200 loan applications per week and generally
approve by hand suddenly received nearly 500 loan applications due to a financial
scandal that hit a competitive bank last week. As a loan officer, my manager wants
me to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within a week. I need
to systematically evaluate the creditworthiness of these new loan applicants and
provide a list of creditworthy customers to my manager in the next two days. The
decision at hand is determining which customers are creditworthy to give a loan to.

We need to build a binary classification model which will predict two outcomes:
whether a customer is creditworthy or not. To achieve this, we will be comparing
the following models to select the most accurate model:

• Logistic Regression
• Decision Tree
• Random Forest
• Boosted Model
